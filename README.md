# Algo Trading Strategies

Hi there ! 👋

*Markets are approached here as dynamic objects shaped by price, time, volatility, information, liquidity, and interaction between participants.*
*Each strategy family represents a different way to model these forces, translate them into algorithms, and reason about their behavior under computation.*

This repository is an exploration of algorithmic trading through code, mathematics, and systems thinking.

The work spans multiple layers of a trading system.
Some components focus on signal formation and market structure, others on regime detection, adaptation, or execution under real-world constraints.
The same ideas are expressed across different environments: high-level experimentation and market interaction through MQL5,  
and low-level, fully controlled simulations through standalone C++ programs.

C++ is used to make assumptions explicit, to control state, time, and randomness, and to study how strategies behave under repeated computation.   MQL5 is used to connect algorithmic logic to realistic market conditions, data availability, and execution models.

Together, these implementations form a coherent horizon:
from abstract hypotheses to concrete algorithms,
from mathematical intuition to executable systems.

All of the simlpe strucutures of presented strategies act as elementary building blocks,  clean, isolated, and explicit, designed to be refined, parameterized, combined, and extended.
Such components can later be embedded in more complex research pipelines, subjected to rigorous backtesting, or integrated into portfolio-level systems.

This repository reflects my personal view of trading as an algorithmic discipline,
where ideas evolve through structure, computation, and clarity.
It does not constitute investment advice, and any examples or results presented here are purely illustrative.
As always, past observations or outcomes do not imply or guarantee future performance.
